# Proposal
## Evaluating website: Florida Energy Systems Consortium
This is a proposal to ask for the responsibility to redesign your current web site. With such a high quality of info, and future investing opportunities, it seems to need a bit more structure and design to be more appealing to an array of users/visitors. In it's current state, it does work but I've found your site to be unresponsive, not very attractive, and the navigation is quite the task to learn. Meaning, when viewed on different devices, such as tablets, mobile phones, and even certain size screens of laptops or desktops, the site breaks. In the event of having to do more than just scroll up or down on any given device, users may become discouraged. It has a lot of content in one area of view, and not very appealing to try to navigate. The color scheme seems that it really hasn't been thought out, in other words too many colors and no flow. 

The purpose of the redesign is to allow your web site to be viewed on all devices, with no errors, and no breaks. Also to make it more readable, and more appealing to ones eye. Florida Energy is involved in the future of energy for us all, so it's best the everyone can actually gain something from the info you are providing. In any way, shape or form. Tablet, phone, or desktop. You want your page to be as responsive as possible.

Some of the things I would like to change to start with is the overall layout of the page. It is quite jumbled, and things are all over the place. Within this process the responsiveness would come into play as well, and the layout would coincide with the responsiveness. Next is the color scheme. There's a lot of colors flowing around, and we can use less colors, and still make it visually beautiful. Also maybe rewrite some of your info. There's alot of words that can be changed to make it easier to read.

  4. Optimize images.
  
  
  ## RESPONSIVENESS
  Site tested on responsivedesignchecker.com
  ## Desktop
  
  1920x1200 24" = Looks good. Good to go.
  
  1680X1050 23" = Paragraphs text too small.

  1366X768  15" = Looks good. Good to go.
  
  1024x600  10" = Main nav crushes together and does not reach across full width of screen, page is not together, have to scroll for L to R.
  
  ## IPAD
  
  Test across the board on IPADS are pretty much the same. Tests were done on the following: IPAD MINI(768X1024), IPAD ASUS Eee100, IPAD PRO(1366X1024), and NEXUS 7(600X960).
  
  Results were as following: Page does not fit screen, main nav breaks, page breaks in multiple locations, things are cut off, and need to use scroll L and R. Overall most Tablets break, and are not responsive.
  
  ## MOBILE DEVICES
  
  All mobile devices fail, and are not acceptable. Page is almost inexistent. Users will not even bother with this web site.

  There is a lot of information to take in here in this report. If you'd like to schedule a sit down, I'd be more than happy to go over this with you and show you exactly the points I'm trying to make, and how I would go about making this page more responsive and more attractive. Users want to be able to navigate easily, and look at interesting things. I can make this happen for you, your web site deserves it, and the info you are providing is a key to our future. If you're interested let me know. Thank you, George Roden.
