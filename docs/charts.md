# Charts used in redesign and reasons why

## Stepped Area Chart

I used, for the first chart, a stepped area chart.
It had a good layout for the data that needed to be inputted into it, and it shows a good clean upward slope as the years go by. Easy to read, and it was easy to insert into current project.

##  Bar Chart

I used a plain old bar chart for my second choice. It's a little jumbled on the right side with the numbers for the BTU's but, it works great when you hover over the years you want to see. It gives a nice clean pop out of the year and the BTU's for that year. I think it's a nice design, and it fits with the rest of the redesign of this site. The jumbled numbers on the right I feel are not really an issue due to the pop out, which clarifies it immensely.
